# Simple Modal Gallery with React and Sass

This project implements a basic image gallery with a modal using the React library and Sass for styling. When a user clicks on an image, a modal window appears displaying a larger version of the image along with its description. The user can navigate through all the images using right and left arrow buttons or keyboard arrow keys. Additionally, users can press the "Esc" key to close the modal.

## Features

- Click on an image to open a modal with a larger image and description.
- Navigate through images using the right and left arrow buttons.
- Use keyboard arrow keys (left and right) to navigate through images.
- Press the "Esc" key or click the close button to close the modal.

## Components

The project is organized into the following components:

- Navbar: Contains only the logo (for now).
- Gallery: Displays the image gallery.
- Modal: Renders the modal with larger images and descriptions.
- Footer: Displays footer information.

## Styling with Sass

- The project utilizes Sass for styling. The Sass files can be found in the src/styles directory. It was my first time using Sass.
